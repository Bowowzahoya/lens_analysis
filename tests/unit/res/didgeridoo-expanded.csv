It consists of one or more venturi chambers in which the diameter of the mouth opening (proximal end) is greater than the diameter of the opening at the distal end (in novel contrast to the construction of any other end-blown musical instrument). This tapered tube constitutes a venturi chamber in which the velocity of air is increased at the point of greatest constriction and in which internal pressure is increased at the point of greatest diameter. This unique acoustical design creates pitches that are much lower than those possible in traditional didgeridoos of equal length.
